    "# Final Project\n",
    "#### You are given a task to build the HR system at your organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objectives:\n",
    "* Demonstrate your understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "* Demonstrate your ability to leverage best performing searching and sorting techniques. \n",
    "* Explain the computational complexity of each searching and sorting implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Design and implement the HR system with following criteria:\n",
    "* You need to be able to search for a staff member using their birthday.\n",
    "* You need to be able to search for a staff member using their zip codes.\n",
    "* You will need to be able to sort staff members using their hiring date.\n",
    "* You need to be able to add/remove a staff member from the system directory\n",
    "* You need to be able to assign reporting hierarchy\n",
    "    * Note: managers are assigned subordinates\n",
    "* There will be one administrator of the HR system\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hints:\n",
    "* You can implement organizational hierarchy using inheritance.\n",
    "* You will probably need to have following classes:\n",
    "    * System Directory: Class that holds objects of the organization members\n",
    "    * Manager: Class representing a manager\n",
    "    * Member: Class representing a staff member. \n",
    "* Draw out relationships between different classes and what attributes + methods each class needs to have to support the project criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Further Instructions:\n",
    "* You cannot use Pandas, NumPy, or any other non-standard Python libraries. \n",
    "* You cannot copy/use other’s work.\n",
    "* You don’t need to use a database. \n",
    "* You don’t need to implement an UI.\n",
    "* You don’t need to create a web application. \n",
    "* You need to include and run test cases\n",
    "* You need to demonstrate the working of your code. \n",
    "* The code will be submitted as a Jupyter notebook via Blackboard.\n"
